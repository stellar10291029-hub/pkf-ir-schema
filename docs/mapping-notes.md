# Mapping Notes

This IR is designed to be:
- Minimal and validate-able (JSON Schema).
- Non-prescriptive: it captures interpretation and interruption, not advice.

Key ideas:
- `domains` capture activated human dimensions.
- `signals` capture kernel-level detection without prescribing action.
- `output.interruption` is the primary deliverable.
